#Default config file for the various bot functions.
#You will be using your own config file named config.ini, do not edit this one.
#If a user config is not found, the bot will make a minimal one for you to use.
#Any setting not found in the user config will default to the values here so
#you only need to set the ones you want to change. However, In [General],
#"bot_token" and "google_api_key" do not have working default values, and you
#must set them yourself.
#A short example of a user config file:
#
#[General]
#bot_token = aLotOfLettersAnd1234567890Numbers
#google_api_key = aDifferntSetOfLettersAnd1234567890Numbers
#embed_color = 0xffffff
#
#Note: Unfortunately every time the user config updates automatically it will
#wipe all of the comments so it is best to refer to this file instead.

#If the event name partially matches the left hand, it will be converted to the
#name on the right hand of the equal sign, for counting purposes. It is used to
#group events with different names that should be counted together.
#When matching, capitalization, spaces and punctuations are automatically
#removed and are only included here for readability. For example:
#    Hello World! = These two will match
#    helloworld = exactly the same event names
#If two things can match the same event, the earlier one set takes priority.
#The text on the right is the name displayed when counting and is unchanged.
#If you have a [PSO2 Summary] section in your user config, it will use those
#rules instead and ignore everything here. You may want to copy some or all
#of these values to your [PSO2 Summary] section as a starter.
